# firstproject
Welcome to my first project! I'm currently learning web development, and this project is a small step in my journey.

-About
This project is built using only HTML. It's a simple webpage where I'm practicing structure, semantic elements, and basic web design concepts.

- What I Learned
HTML structure (headings, paragraphs, lists, etc.)
Using images and links
Basic forms and tables
- Notes
I'm still learning, so any feedback or suggestions are welcome! Feel free to explore, and if you have any tips, let me know. 

If you want something more detailed or formal, I can tweak it!
