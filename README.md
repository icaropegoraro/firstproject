# firstproject
Welcome to my first project! I'm currently learning web development, and this project is a small step in my journey.

- About //
This project is built using only HTML. It's a simple webpage where I'm practicing structure, semantic elements, and basic web design concepts.

- What I Learned //
HTML structure (headings, paragraphs, lists, etc.) ; 
Using images and links ; 
Basic forms and tables .

- Notes //
I'm still learning, so any feedback or suggestions are welcome! Feel free to explore, and if you have any tips, let me know. 

If you want something more detailed or formal, I can tweak it!
